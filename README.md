# Budget App Project

Budgtr is an application where people can log their financial transactions. This application bring together all I've learned about JavaScript, building websites, React, servers and RESTful routes.

### Project Features & Deployment

### Back-end 

The back-end application was built with a RESTful server that performs CRUD actions on a single resource, including an appropriate "Not Found" response given when a route is requested that does not match the created routes and a validation rule.

Please see repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/elizabethbright721/budget-app-backend)

The back-end is deployed on [Render] (https://budget-app-back-end-xhn3.onrender.com/)

### Front-end

The front end was built with a React application that allows for CRUD operations to be performed on a single resource.  

The front-end is deployed on [Netlify](https://budget-app-project-eab.netlify.app)
